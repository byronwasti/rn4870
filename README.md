# rn4870

## Note: Maintenance Mode

Unfortunately I no longer have the time to actively develop this crate. However, I am happy to review and accept PRs. Happy to pass on ownership on crates.io -- please contact me!

## Functionality
- Switch to Command Mode
- Switch to Data Mode
- Set BLE name
- Turn on default services
- Basic transparent UART service transmit and receive
- Hardware Reset module

## TODO
- Rework the state machine system to be more error friendly 
- Implement all the various Command Mode functionality
- Serial read is extremely finicky and prone to overrun

## Examples

Examples will be available soon enough!
